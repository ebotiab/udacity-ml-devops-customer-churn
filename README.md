# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

In this project, participants are tasked with applying their knowledge to pinpoint credit card customers with a high likelihood of churn. The end result will be a set of Python scripts encapsulating a machine learning project, crafted in adherence to the PEP8 coding standards and embodying the best practices in software engineeringâ€”modularity, documentation, and thorough testing. Designed for versatility, the package can be operated both interactively and via the command-line interface (CLI). This endeavor serves as a practical exercise in implementing testing, logging, and optimal coding techniques learned in this course. Furthermore, it presents a real-world challenge commonly encountered by data scientists across various industries: identifying customers at risk of churn and devising strategies for retention.

## Files and data description

- **data/**: This directory contains the dataset utilized in the project. These dataset include the information on credit card customers necessary for analyzing and predicting churn.

- **models/**: This folder holds the trained machine learning models that have been developed to predict customer churn. These models are the output of the analysis and training process.

- **Guide.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook providing guidance on how to navigate through and utilize the project, including steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **README.md**: The markdown file containing an overview of the project, including its purpose, structure, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

- **churn_library.py**: A Python library that encapsulates the core functionality of the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction routines, adhering to best coding practices.

- **churn_notebook.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the workflow of the project from data loading, analysis, model training, and evaluation, serving as an interactive guide.

- **churn_script_logging_and_tests.py**: This script contains logging and unit tests for the project, ensuring the code quality and reliability of the functions within the Python package.

- **requirements_py3.6.txt**: A file listing the project dependencies required for Python 3.6 environment, ensuring reproducibility.

- **requirements_py3.8.txt**: Similarly, this file specifies the dependencies for the project in a Python 3.8 environment, facilitating the setup in different Python versions.

## Running Files

To run the files in this project and fully utilize its capabilities, follow the steps outlined below for different components:

### 1. Setup Environment

First, ensure that your Python environment is correctly set up with the necessary dependencies:

- Install the required packages using the `requirements_py3.6.txt` or `requirements_py3.8.txt` file, depending on your Python version:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements_py3.[6|8].txt
  ```

#### 2. Data Preparation

- Navigate to the `data/` directory and ensure that your dataset files are correctly placed. The project expects specific data files to be present in this directory for processing.

### 3. Running the Python Library (`churn_library.py`)

- This library encapsulates the core functionality including data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
- Execute the library script from the command line:

  ```bash
  ipython churn_library.py
  ```

- Upon running, the script will preprocess the data, train the model(s), evaluate performance, and save the output models to the models/ directory.

### 5. Testing and Logging (`churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`)

- To ensure the reliability and stability of the project code, run the logging and test script:

  ```bash
  python churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
  ```

- This script will execute a series of tests on the functions within the `churn_library.py` and log the outcomes, highlighting any errors or issues in the process.
